This is For Models Conversions.
We cannot offer all the models on Github due to the limitations. But we offered a link for some models:https://lx200916-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/lx_lx0_xyz/EcBdD8yUZWRFsnoRQCmK5S0BIsZNl1d1HXEYnEVGdDJn3g?e=ca08BO
and some models can be downloaded from other website.Please execute ./download_model.sh to get them.
We also built some tools that you can convert models.
1. download or git clone the MACE Project to ./MACE_master.
2. download the models and unzip them to this folder.
3. To convert MNN: run `bash MNN.sh`.
Notice: We only built the binaries for linux_amd64 architecture.Built yourself along with `https://github.com/alibaba/MNN`.
To convert MACE:
1. Check that your python and tensorflow version is supported on `https://mace.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/env_requirement.html`. You may need virtual environment or Docker.
2. Edit `mace_template.yml`with your model information and place it under ./mace_models
3. Run `bash MACE.sh`.
Notice: First Run maybe extremely slow since mace will built itself and some toolchains.
To convert NCNN:
Built tools due to `https://github.com/Tencent/ncnn/tree/master/tools`.
To convert TFLite:
Use `tflite_convert`.
To convert SNPE:
We cannot offer the binaries. See the SNPE documentation for details.
